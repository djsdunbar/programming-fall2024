        <h2><center> Ingredients</center></h2>
<ul>
    <li> 5 tablespoons (71 grams) unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups (249 grams) granulated sugar </li>
    <li> 2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk, cold</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li> 1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (75 grams) cocoa powder </li>
    <li>1/2 cup (63 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (128 grams) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    
</ul>

        <h2><center> Steps</center></h2>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line an 8 by 8-inch light-colored metal pan with foil or parchment paper and spray with nonstick cooking spray. </li>
    <li> In a microwave-safe bowl, add the butter and sugar. Microwave for about 1 minute, or until the butter is melted. Whisk in the eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla. Stir in the oil and cocoa powder.</li>
    <li>With a rubber spatula, stir in the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
    <li> Spread the brownie batter evenly into the prepared pan. Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the brownies are set and a cake tester inserted into the center has moist crumbs attached. Do not overcook. Let cool completely to solidify before cutting and serving.</li>
    <li> Brownies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. Brownies will be gooey when served warm, chewy when served at room temperature, and fudgy when served chilled. </li>
    <li> Cut up the brownies and Enjoy!</li>
