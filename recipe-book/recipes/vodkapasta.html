        <center><h2> Description</h2></center>
        <p> This dish is the easiest dish to make. It is really good to make to a family dinner, a cute date and if you want a quick meal after a long day. Follow the steps below to make a yummy bowl of pasta. <b>NO! YOU WILL NOT GET DRUNK OFF THIS PASTA!</b></p>

        <h2><center> Ingredients</center></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Tomato Paste</li>
    <li>Vodka</li>
    <li>Pasta(any kind) </li>
    <li>Heavy Cream</li>
    <li>Parmesan</li>
    <li>onion</li>
    <li>garlic</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
    <li>red pepper flakes</li>


</ul>

        <h2><center> Steps</center></h2>

<ol>
    <li>Saute the minced onion and garlic with the olive oil and a pinch of salt.</li>
    <li> Then, add the tomato paste and crushed red pepper flakes. You want to cook the tomato paste until it turns a very dark red color.</li>
    <li>Pour in the vodka and cook it for about a minute. You really want it to sizzle up and burn off.</li>
    <li> Next, add the heavy cream and stir it until smooth. Turn the sauce off. Now it’s time to cook the pasta!</li>
    <li> Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta when it’s boiling and cook it just shy of 1 minute until al dente. I like to do this so we can cook the rest of the pasta in the sauce. </li>
    <li>Then, scoop out about a cup of pasta water. Pour 1/2 cup of pasta water into the sauce, add the grated cheese and then taste it. Add more salt to your liking. I added a few more pinches of salt.</li>
    <li> Pour in the drained pasta and then the cold butter. Stir for 1 minute. This may seem like a long time but it really does help emulsify the sauce.</li>
    <li> Serve it up and garnish with more Parmesan-Reggiano and minced Italian parsley.</li>
